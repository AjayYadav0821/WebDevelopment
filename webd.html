            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Robotics is a branch of engineering focused on the design, development, and implementation of robots, or autonomous machines meant to replicate human effort.Footnote1 At its core, robotics combines computer science with mechanical and electrical engineering to accomplish a variety of tasks.Footnote2 This encompasses everything from the design of neural networks and algorithms that program robots to product development and testing.
                The field continues to grow with the advent of big data and the Internet of Things (IoT). Machines are now capable of processing large quantities of data and learning with minimal human interaction.Footnote3 For example, the sensors on todayâ€™s autonomous vehicles process thousands of data points each second, along with location data from the web, to move a vehicle safely along its route.Footnote4
                Robotics engineers may have background knowledge or professional experience in adjacent fields. Robotics projects and applications can be found across a large number of industries, from automotive production to military drone operations and even space exploration.Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it's the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience. Web developers, do this by using a variety of coding languages.
